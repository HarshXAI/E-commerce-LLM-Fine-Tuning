## LLM Fine-Tuning Process

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architectural documentation focusing on the LLM fine-tuning process specifically using Llama 2, LoRA, and QLoRA quantizations.

### Overview of Llama 2
Llama 2 is an advanced language model that supports various fine-tuning techniques to adapt the model for specific tasks. This section will outline the key features of Llama 2 and why it's suitable for fine-tuning.

### Fine-Tuning Techniques

1. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
   - **Description**: LoRA is a method that allows for efficient fine-tuning of large models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into each layer of the transformer architecture.
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `rank`: Determines the size of the low-rank matrices.
     - `alpha`: Scaling factor for the updates.
   - **Training Process**:
     - Initialize the model with pre-trained weights.
     - Apply low-rank adaptations during training.
     - Fine-tune on the target dataset.

2. **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)**
   - **Description**: QLoRA extends LoRA by introducing quantization, allowing for even more efficient training and inference with reduced memory usage.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `quantization_bits`: Number of bits to use for quantization.
     - `trainable_layers`: Specifies which layers to apply QLoRA to.
   - **Training Process**:
     - Similar to LoRA, but incorporates quantization for lower memory overhead.

### System Architecture
The system architecture for fine-tuning involves several components:

- **Data Pipeline**: Ingests and preprocesses training data.
- **Training Module**: Manages the fine-tuning process, including hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
- **Inference Module**: Deploys the fine-tuned models for real-time predictions.

### Conclusion
This documentation serves as a guide for understanding the architectural decisions and processes involved in fine-tuning large language models using Llama 2, LoRA, and QLoRA. For further details, refer to the respective sections for each technique and parameter settings.
